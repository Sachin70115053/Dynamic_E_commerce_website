# Dynamic_E_commerce_website

Welcome to the E-commerce Website project! This README file provides an overview of the project, its technologies, and its current status.

Introduction
The E-commerce Website project is aimed at creating a full-fledged e-commerce platform that provides users with a seamless online shopping experience. The project is divided into two main parts: the backend, which handles data management and serves API endpoints, and the frontend, responsible for interacting with users.

Technologies Used
Backend
Node.js: A runtime environment for building server-side logic.
Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used to create robust APIs.
MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing and managing application data.
REST API: The communication protocol used to interact with the backend.
Frontend (Currently Working On)
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Redux: A state management library for managing the application's global state.
Features
The E-commerce Website project includes the following features:

User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts and log in to the platform.
User Profiles: Users can view and manage their profiles and account settings.
Admin Portals: Different admin portals for managing products, orders, and inventory.
Secure Cart System: Users can add products to their carts and proceed to checkout.
Admin-Only Resources: Certain resources and functionalities are accessible to administrators only.
Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Install dependencies for both the backend and frontend: npm install
Set up your MongoDB database and update the connection details in the backend configuration.
Configure environment variables (if applicable).
Start the backend server: npm run start
Start the frontend development server: npm run start
Currently Working On
The project is currently focused on two main tasks:

Frontend Development: The frontend is being developed using React and Redux to create an interactive user interface. Users can browse products, add them to their carts, and proceed to checkout.

Payment Gateway Integration (Backend): Integration of a payment gateway into the backend for secure payment processing.

Deployment: Preparing the application for deployment on a hosting platform of choice, such as Heroku, AWS, or Netlify. Ensuring that all environment variables are properly set and following deployment best practices.
